Since Wikidata is a knowledge graph that often relies on real-world entities and facts, it might not have detailed information about fictional characters like James Bond's marital status across all media. However, we can try to retrieve his marital status from the films where this information is explicitly stated. Here are the SPARQL commands for Sparklis: <commands> a film; property film director; \"Terence Young\"; property film title; \"Dr. No\"; property film character; \"James Bond\"; property film character marital status </commands> This query will return the marital status of James Bond from the movie \"Dr. No\" directed by Terence Young. If you want to check his marital status in other movies as well, you would need to run this command multiple times, changing the director and film title each time. Alternatively, if Wikidata has a more general property for James Bond's marital status across all media, you could use that instead of specifying individual films. In practice, for complex fictional character queries like this one, it might be better to consult a database or knowledge graph specifically dedicated to the fictional universe in question, if available.\nExtracted commands - tag: commands\n\nCommands execution - commands: a film; property film director; \"Terence Young\"; property film title; \"Dr. No\"; property film character; \"James Bond\"; property film character marital status\n\nGet results\n\nTry 16\n\nLLM generation - system prompt: commands_chain_system_prompt_the_most_improved - user input: Is James Bond married?\nA: - The question asks if James Bond is married.

If you want to get the series with more episodes, you can use sorting commands: <commands> Breaking Bad; property number of episodes; desc Game of Thrones; property number of episodes; desc </commands> This will give you the series with the most episodes first.

After getting the episode counts, we sort in descending order and limit to 1 to get the show with the highest count. If Breaking Bad comes first, it has more episodes than Game of Thrones. Alternative approach (if you want to compare directly without sorting): <commands>Breaking Bad; property number of episodes; Game of Thrones; property number of episodes; > </commands> - Here, we use the '>' operator to directly compare the episode counts.

Here's how you can do it using Sparklis commands: <commands>Breaking Bad; property number of episodes; groupBy count; asc, Game of Thrones; property number of episodes; groupBy count; asc</commands> This will give us two numbers representing the total number of episodes for each show.

To determine which is bigger, you would need to compare these results manually or use additional commands like \"asc\" and \"desc\" along with \"limit 1\". However, Sparklis does not support complex comparisons out of the box, so we'll stick to retrieving the necessary data here. Final answer: This query will give us the areas of both lakes.

Filter by area, only considering those larger than 30,000 square kilometers (an arbitrary value to filter out smaller lakes). 3. Limit the results to 2, as we want to compare only these two largest lakes. 4. Sort in descending order based on area. 5. Offset by 1 to get the second-largest lake after Lake Baikal.
