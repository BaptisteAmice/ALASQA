Identify who Marc Chagall was: - Marc Chagall (1887-1985) was a Russian-French artist and one of the most significant figures in 20th-century art. 2. Determine his nationality: - He was born in Vitebsk, Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Belarus), which at that time was part of Russia. - He became a French citizen later in life. 3. Assess his religious affiliation: - Chagall was born into a family of Hasidic Jews and remained deeply connected to his Jewish heritage throughout his life. - Despite converting to Russian Orthodox Christianity as an adult, he continued to identify strongly with Judaism. 4. Consider the historical context: - While Chagall converted from Judaism to Russian Orthodoxy for personal reasons, he never abandoned his Jewish identity or his Jewish community. Based on these points, we can conclude that Marc Chagall was indeed a Jew by birth and heritage. Therefore, the answer is: <answer>true</answer>\nExtracted SPARQL - tag: answer"

Given these points, tree frogs belong to the group of amphibians because they meet the criteria for this classification: - They breathe with lungs and through their moist skin (like other amphibians). - Their life cycle involves a metamorphosis from an aquatic larval stage (tadpole) to an adult form that can live on land.

The person referred to as \"U.S. president Jackson\" is likely referring to Andrew Jackson, the seventh President of the United States. 2. Andrew Jackson served two terms from 1829 to 1837. 3. During his presidency, there were no major wars that he was directly involved in as a commander-in-chief or through direct military action. 4. However, it's important to note that during his lifetime and presidency, the United States did engage in several conflicts: - The Second Seminole War (1835-1842) - The First Anglo-Ashante War (1823-1824), which was conducted by British troops with Jackson's support - The Creek War of 1813\u20131814, in which Jackson led U.S. forces as a general. 5. Despite his role in these conflicts, they were not wars initiated or directly managed by Andrew Jackson himself while he was president.
