Definition of a sport: Sports are typically physical activities that involve competition and usually have rules. 2. Horse racing involves horses competing in races against each other over specific distances. 3. The activity requires skill, training, and physical effort from both the jockey (human) and the horse. 4. There is a clear winner determined by which horse crosses the finish line first. Considering these points: - Horse racing meets the criteria of being a competitive activity with rules. - It involves physical exertion for the horses and requires skill from the human participants (jockeys). Given this analysis, we can conclude that horse racing does fit the definition of a sport. <answer>true</answer>\nExtracted SPARQL - tag: answer"

Subsequent films have occasionally hinted at or shown Bond having been married, but these details are inconsistent across different adaptations and are often changed for the purpose of the story. Given that James Bond's marital status is not consistently portrayed in all media, it would be inaccurate to definitively state whether he is married based on fictional accounts alone. However, since this question seems to be seeking a singular answer: The most accurate response considering all these factors can be described as 'no' because his marital status within the collective franchise of James Bond is not consistent or explicitly stated. <answer>false</answer>\nExtracted SPARQL - tag: answer"
