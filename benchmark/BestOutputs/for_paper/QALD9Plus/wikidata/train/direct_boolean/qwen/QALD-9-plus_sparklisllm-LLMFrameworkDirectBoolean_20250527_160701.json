The question asks if U.S. President Andrew Jackson was involved in a war. 2. Andrew Jackson was the 7th President of the United States, serving from 1829 to 1837. 3. He is best known for leading American forces during the War of 1812 against Britain and its allies. 4. In addition to being involved in the war itself, Jackson also played a significant role in the Battle of New Orleans. 5. However, he did not lead any specific wars as president; his presidency was marked by domestic policies rather than military actions. Based on this analysis, while Andrew Jackson was indeed involved in a war (the War of 1812), it is more accurate to say that he fought in the war rather than being involved in one as a sitting president. <answer>false</answer>\nExtracted SPARQL - tag: answer"

First, we need to find out how many episodes are in \"Breaking Bad\". The show consists of 5 seasons. 2. Season 1 has 8 episodes, 3. Season 2 also has 8 episodes, 4. Season 3 is the shortest with 15 episodes, 5. Season 4 expands again with 16 episodes, and 6. Lastly, Season 5 concludes the series with 10 episodes. Adding these up: 8 + 8 + 15 + 16 + 10 = 57 episodes in total for \"Breaking Bad\". Now let's do a similar calculation for \"Game of Thrones\": 1. The show also has 5 seasons. 2. Season 1, 2, and 3 each have 10 episodes, 3. Season 4 and 5 have 9 episodes each. Adding these up: 10 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 9 = 48 episodes in total for \"Game of Thrones\".
