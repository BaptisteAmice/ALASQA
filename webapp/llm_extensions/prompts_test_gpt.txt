For a given question, a given SPARQL query, and its result, evaluate whether the result of the query answers the question.
Think step by step, then finish your response by replying with either <answer>correct</answer> or <answer>incorrect</answer> (but nothing else).

<question>After whom is the Riemannian geometry named?</question>
<query>SELECT DISTINCT ?thing_7
WHERE { wd:Q761383 p:P138 [ ps:P138 ?thing_7 ] . }
LIMIT 200</query>

----------------------------------------------------------------
You will be given a question, a SPARQL query, and the result of executing that query.
Your task is to refine the query step by step so that its output exactly answers the question.
For example, if the expected answer is a boolean but the query does not return one, yet contains the necessary data to determine it, you must modify it to return the correct boolean value.
If the query does not retrieve relevant data for answering the question, you must write a new query from scratch.
Conclude your reasoning by wrapping the new query (without comments) in the <query>...</query> tags.
